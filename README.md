# Genetic_Algorithm_CW

The aim of this progect was to use the testGA.m algorithm, written on MATLAB, by using the Rastrigin’s function and attempting to find its global minimum.

The Rastrigin’s function is a non-convex function used to test genetic algorithms. It is based on De Jong’s sphere model, which is continuous, convex and unimodal, with the addition of cosine modulation to produce many regularly distributed local minima [1]. The large search space and high number of minima and maxima make the Rastrigin’s function a challenging test function for optimisation.
